// About section
export const textsAbout: string[] = [
  `I'm passionate about design and development, specializing in web design, web development, graphic design, print design, product design, branding, game development, motion graphics, and more.`,

  ` I love creating immersive web experiences that stand out, leave a lasting impression, and push the boundaries of what's possible, helping shape the future of the web.`,

  `As a web developer, I primarily work with React, Next.js, TypeScript, GSAP, Three.js, React Three Fiber, Zustand, Tailwind, Sass, Pixi.js, p5.js, alongside various other frameworks and libraries.`,

  `I am proficient in a wide range of tools, including Figma, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Animate, After Effects, Premiere, Lightroom, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro, and Ableton Live.`,

  ` I also work with free software alternatives like Inkscape, Krita, GIMP, and Blender. I'm passionate about free software. I enjoy using it and fully support its development and growth.`,

  `My mantra is: always choose the right tool for the job and avoid over-engineering.`,

  `I have lived, studied, and worked in Greece, Spain (Barcelona), and the UK (Brighton). I am fluent in Greek, English, and Spanish.`,

  `I used to have a rubber duck on my desk, but now it shares space with a Maneki-neko, the iconic Japanese lucky cat figurine. Together, they bring a mix of fun and good fortune to my workspace!`,

  `I don't drink coffee or tea. Well, maybe a cup of tea a few times a year, but that's about it.`,

// This Website section
export const textsThisWebsite: string[] = [
  `When did the web become so serious? This website is a love letter to the early Internet, a tribute to the era of naÃ¯ve web art, romantic digital amateurs, and the beautiful chaos of GeoCities.`,
  `I first discovered the magical world of the World Wide Web in the â€™90s, and this project is my attempt to bottle some of that pixelated magic. Its visual language borrows from street art, print-era layout experimentation, and the punchy, graphic attitude of â€™90s MTV.`,

  `I call the resulting aesthetic <i>frivobrutalism</i>, a joyful clash of whimsy and rawness, where playful visuals meet the structural honesty of brutalist design.`,
